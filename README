Description: Searches for the carrier unlock code for the Samsung Galaxy S 4G
             in a fast and easy way. The location of the unlock code is fixed at
             0x146E in the nv_data.bin file. :). This project finally been
             written in pure ANSI C to avoid inconsistencies in the software
             that is typically installed on  phones (such as busybox and other
             shell utilities). Once statically compiled, the native binary will
             work on any version of Android as long as the phone is rooted.

Notes: I have compiled this with GCC 4.6 on Ubuntu 12.04. The program does not
       have any dependencies on Android specific code which means that as long
       as you have a backup of the nv_data.bin file from the phone, you can get
       the unlock code on your PC instead of directly on the phone. This also
       means that you don't have to go through the hassle of cross compiling.
       The default location of the nv_data.bin file is:
       /efs/root/afs/settings/nv_data.bin

Target Phone Models:
    Samsung SGH-T959V
    Samsung SGH-T959W

Compilation Instructions: To compile with the codesourcery cross compiler,
    arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc --static -o unlock_code unlocker.c
